47	1	48	<b>HOW TO TASTE WINE</b> <br><br> <b>Professional</b> wine tasters do not treat the process casually.  Maybe it's not even fun at times, since they have to dissect, in minutest detail, every sip of every wine.  It's their job.  You, on the other hand, are not accountable to anybody but yourself. The degree of seriousness aside, there are some key factors one looks for in assessing wine. You certainly don't have to like what is considered excellent wine, but you should have an appreciation for why it is considered such.  Also, it makes drinking better wines a much deeper, richer experience.    <br><br> <b>There</b> are several kinds of tasting.  One is for people who barely know the difference between red and white - uncommon but not unheard of.  In this case, choose five bottles, a light young red, a mature red, a dry white, a sweet white, and a port or sherry.   For a more discerning group, choose five different varietals, like a Zinfandel, Pinot Noir, Cabernet, Merlot and Syrah, to illuminate the distinct differences in so-called &quot;red&quot; wines.  Another method might be to select Chardonnays from as many different growing regions as is practical (include several countries and states) to determine what the &quot;baseline Chardonnay&quot; taste is, and how that taste can vary depending upon where it's grown.  This is a delightful way to explore a single varietal in depth. <br><br> <b>For</b> the more serious taster there are horizontal and vertical tastings.  Horizontal would be, for example, ten Cabernets from the same year but different wineries; vertical means all the Cabernets are from different years.   This give insight as to what constitutes an excellent Cabernet - again, in your opinion. <br><br> <b>You </b>can taste blind -- without seeing the labels --  or in full view of the facts.  Blind tasting insures you are not swayed by a wine's reputation.  You'll detect what you're supposed to detect, not what you think you're supposed to detect.   In blind tasting competitions, the object is to guess correctly the wine and the vintage, and the best team wins.  In competitive tastings wine against wine, such as pitting Cabernets from California against Bordeaux from France, the tasting is done blind to insure a fair out come - so the more established reputation of the Bordeaux  region doesn't wield more clout than it deserves to.  <br><br> <b>When </b>several wines are being tasted, the order should be youngest and lightest wines first followed by older more full-bodied ones.  To reverse this order is to overwhelm any subtleties a younger, lighter wine might have accrued and is not a fair assessment. <br><br> <b>And </b>what are you looking for in evaluating wine?  Appearance first, then smell, impression in the mouth, total flavor in the mouth, and aftertaste. <br><br> <b>Appearance </b>consists of a wine's clarity and its color.   As red wines age they fade, going from deep purple to, eventually, a brick color, whereas white wines grow darker.  The best way to judge color is against a white background, a tablecloth or piece of paper, with not a lot of wine in the glass.  Also part of a wine's appearance is the wine's viscosity or &quot;legs,&quot; which run down the sides of the glass when it is swirled.  The more slow moving the legs, the denser the flavor.  So if a red wine is pale to brickish and has slow moving legs you can expect it to be mature. 	 <br><br> <b>Our </b>centers for smell are located right next to our memory centers.  One good whiff of a wine that has been swirled in the glass a couple times should evoke distinct memories -  of honey, flowers, mushrooms, citrus, butter, for example -  it will also remind you that you've had this wine before, or alert you to the vinegary or moldy scent of a bad wine.  First impressions are crucial here and far more reliable than subsequent sniffs.   Based on appearance and smell, you now have enough information to determine a wine's overall quality and age. <br><br> <b>Tasting </b>the wine fills in some blanks, mainly with regard to a wine's &quot;balance.&quot;  Take a generous sip and swirl it in your mouth.  The weight of the wine in your mouth will tell you whether it's light-, medium- or full-bodied.  It  also tells you how much sweetness, acidity, alcohol and tannin it contains.  The object is for these elements to harmonize pleasantly.  If one element is dominant, a proficient taster will know whether that imbalance is a flaw, or is  acceptable in the wine being tasted.  (A young red wine might be overly tannic but with definite fruitiness, suggesting that in a few years the tannin will have been moderated by the fruit; in this case too much tannin is perfectly acceptable.) The ultimate moment in tasting is just before the wine is swallowed, when the vapors hit the upper nasal cavities.   <br><br> <b>In </b>France, the concept of aftertaste  has been quantified in the form of a &quot;caudalie.&quot;  If the flavor of the wine stays in your mouth after swallowing for one second, that wine has achieved one caudalie.   The more caudalies the better, especially with the wines of Burgundy. Really good wines make the strongest impressions with their smell and their aftertaste. <br><br> <b>If </b>you're a professional taster, or if the information obtained is to be used for any important purpose, like a wine review, you should spit out each sip.  Not as much fun, for sure, but it does make for a clear head. <br><br> <b>Finally</b>, it's a good idea to keep notes about the wines you taste so you can enjoy - or steer clear of - those precise wines again, or so you can  get wines with similar characteristics.  And feel free to develop your own rating system.  Professional ratings are very helpful in a broad sense but they can't compare to what you think about a wine. <br><br> <b>At </b>some point you may want to take an actual wine tasting class -- talk to your local wine shop for recommendations or visit our On-Line Resources page for some suggestions.	24	NULL

51	1	52	<b>PAIRING WINE WITH FOOD</b> <br><br> <i><b>True or False:</b></i>   White wine is to be drunk with white meats and fish,              red wine goes with beef, and sweet wines go with desserts, period, and to do it               any other way is courting a visit from the Wine Police.             <br><br>             The answer is False, but the truth is that until a couple decades ago this is how              people decided what to drink with dinner.   Thankfully, our minds have broadened.              The current thinking is that since food can be every bit as complex as wine, the              options for creating rich pairings are staggering.   And it cannot be stressed              enough: a successful pairing is one that you find pleasing -- maybe nobody else on              the planet likes Champagne with liverwurst, but you happen to find the combination              absolutely transporting.              <br><br>             If there is a rule of thumb it would be either to go for complementary flavors or              flavors that contrast.  For example, a dish with citrus would be complemented by a              fruity wine; a hearty stew would go well with a full-bodied wine; and a delicately              flavored dish, such as poached sole, would be in good company with a dry, crisp              wine.   Whereas a rich cream sauce would contrast nicely with a highly acidic dry              wine; and a simple snack of bread and cheese would turn positively ambrosial when              paired with a complex full-bodied red.  The best advice of all is to experiment,              open-mindedly, and frequently.             <br><br>             What follows are some truths about how wine can react with food:              <ul>             <li>A wine high in tannins (Bordeaux, for instance) mated with a food high in              tannins (like walnuts) will render the wine almost undrinkably dry and astringent.              <br><br>             <li>Protein tends to calm tannins, so a very tannic wine might be rendered              glorious when enjoyed with rare beef.             <br><br>             <li>Delicate foods - veal, or filet of sole for example - will be overwhelmed by a              full-bodied red wine.  By the same token, a hearty lasagna will virtually cancel              out a dry, medium-bodied Sauvignon Blanc.             <br><br>             <li>A wine can add its primary flavor to a dish, giving food a layer it didn't              start out with.              <br><br>             <li>Some wine and food combinations result in a flavor that was not present in              either one and is not meant to be, metal for instance.  Try white turkey meat with              red Bordeaux if you doubt this.             <br><br>             <li>Sometimes it's as though this wine has been searching all its life for this              food and fireworks ensue.               <br><br>             <li>Tannic wines make sweet foods taste less sweet; salty foods emphasize tannin.             <br><br>             <li>Salty foods mute the sweetness and enhance the fruitiness of a sweet wine.             <br><br>             <li>Wines that are high in acid taste less acidic with salty or sweet  food;              acidic wines also can offset oily foods.             </ul>             Remember - any combination you enjoy is a good combination!	24	NULL

57	1	58	  <b>COMPANY OVERVIEW</b> <br><br>           Launched in May 1999, wine.com has quietly become the front-runner in the wine B2C e-tailing market segment.  The only multi-state licensed web-based wine retailer in the United States, eVineyard, Inc.  possesses a number of competitive advantages, not the least being the current regulatory environment.  As the only pure-play online wine retailer-featuring the web's largest selection of competitively priced, high quality, well known labels-the company is ideally positioned to establish a long-term leadership position in this space. <br><br> eVineyard's growth, since launch, exceeds 150&#037; per quarter on average, driven by the company's ability to provide customer satisfaction with a unique combination of service, selection, and speed. <br><br> With its superior selection and delivery capabilities, wine.com is well positioned to capitalize on the rapidly expanding online wine market, now projected to exceed &#036;1.8B by 2003. <br><br> eVineyard, Inc. through its online storefront wine.com legally serves more than 63&#037; of the domestic market for off-premise premium wine sales.  A licensed retailer serving 25 states, eVineyard, Inc. has logistic centers in seven of those.  With the imminent opening of three additional logistic centers, the company will increase its market access to more than 75&#037; of the total market with a physical presence in each of the country's top 10 wine markets. <br><br> An impressive portfolio of more than 3,000 domestic and imported labels makes wine.com the most comprehensive wine store on the web.  The company's introduction of &quot;virtual wine inventory&quot; positions it to become the most successful wine e-tailer in the world.  With its use of the three-tier distribution channel, eVineyard purchases wine directly from 26 high-volume and numerous smaller wholesalers.  In turn, these wholesalers provide daily just-in-time delivery to meet consumer demands while eliminating the need for costly and limiting inventory.  This unique delivery model allows eVineyard to process most customer requests within one business day, the fastest fulfillment available from any online wine retailer. <br><br> At present, the wine.com revenue stems from four main sources, the most significant being direct shipment.  Although initial revenues will flow primarily from sales to new customers, the company expects more than 60&#037; of direct sales will come from repeat customers by the end of 2002.  Meanwhile, the company conservatively anticipates an average of five purchases per customer each year. <br><br> Since entering the premium wine market, wine.com has experienced rapid growth in the number of customers that order wine from its site.  In 1999, accounts grew sharply as the company quietly executed its business strategy.  During the first quarter of 2000, growth continued, resulting in more than a 40&#037; increase in its customer base and over 125&#037; increase in account registrations. <br><br> By year's end, wine.com will offer more than 3,000 premium wine labels in each market.  Simultaneously, the company will offer complementary products and services such as accessories and cellars, auctions and business services.  These additional products will enhance consumers' wine-buying experiences while business services streamline wholesaler and retailer inventory, and information management and publication.  <br><br> wine.com (<a href="/home">www.wine.com</a>) continues to supply its customers with exceptional online service.  The company's Live Talk Chat Room allows shoppers to communicate one-on-one with an eVineyard wine expert.  In addition, wine.com has established exclusive relationships with NBC Internet, Inc. (NBCi) and Salon.com, making it the only recognized online wine retailer at both sites, and the anchor tenant at Snap.com's Wine Shop and Wine Resource Center.	24	NULL

In addition, we&#146;ll send you notes on why these particular wines were             chosen, what to expect from each wine, and what to serve with them, all written in terms you              can understand without a degree in wine sciences.

With so much diversity, how do you <A Href="/browse/shop.asp?pick_type=12">pick a wine</a> to serve? Have we got some suggestions?! Think opportunity and versatility!  <p> <b>Let's start with opportunity.</b> <br> Wine can complement every stage of the celebration, from the moment guests arrive, to the end-of-day slumbering by the fire. As for selecting wines that will stand up to the richness of a well-stocked Thanksgiving meal, versatility is key. Keeping that in mind, we've selected a list of affordable wines that will complement the wide spectrum of flavors and enhance the celebration. Simply click on a wine you're interested in to get more information or order.  <p> <b>The Warm Up</b> <br> Some people haven't seen each other, have never met or just plain don't talk to each other. Why not give them something to talk about? A light sparkling wine or Riesling could liven up the room while tastefully complementing appetizers.  <br><br> <a href="/product/display.asp?PProduct_ID=75073">Gloria Ferrer NV Blanc de Noirs</a><br> <a href="/product/display.asp?PProduct_ID=MHB407025">Kendall Jackson 1998 Johannisberg Reisling Vintners Reserve</a> <p> <b>The Main Event</b> <br> The turkey is the heavyweight of the table and it must be noticed. Whether you're contending with a tender turkey or a turkey-turned-kindling, we've suggested a range of selections that will stand up in the ring. Again, our focus is on versatility. We suggest a wide range of whites moving from buttery smooth Chardonnays to Rieslings. For a wine that gets along famously with all kinds of foods, try a dry, medium bodied Pinot Noir.  <br><br> <a href="/product/display.asp?PProduct_ID=85683">St. Francis 1997 Chardonnay Reserve</a><br> <a href="/product/display.asp?PProduct_ID=PDXMCW0452">Fess Parker 1997 Riesling</a><br> <a href="/product/display.asp?PProduct_ID=MCW1846">David Bruce 1997 Pinot Noir</a> <p> <b>The Big Finish</b> <br> Dessert is just as big an event as dinner. With any luck, your guests will be rested and ready to step up and take a swing. Again, the sky's the limit and, so are the pairing possibilities. A clean bubbly can awaken your guests' senses and add a degree of celebration to any dessert. The Rieslings, the lightest choice we suggest, are very refreshing with pumpkin pies. But if picking up a fork is too much at this point, try our Liquid Dessert suggestions. Consider toasting the day by the fire with the warm finish of a Port. <br><br> <a href="/product/display.asp?PProduct_ID=88180">Argyle 1995 Brut</a><br> <a href="/product/display.asp?PProduct_ID=83513">Taylor Fladgate Late Bottled Vintage Port</a><br> <a href="/product/display.asp?PProduct_ID=86445">Taylor Fladgate 10 Year-old Tawny</a> <br><br>	24	NULL

170	1	170	The Riedel connoisseur will be surprised to find that this new glass series has something missing; there is no stem or base. Riedel 'O' is the new innovative take on the wine tumbler, the designs of which are based on the benchmark shapes of the Riedel Vinum. For the first time in glass history the design parameters such as shape of tumbler, size and diameter of rim, have been fine tuned to enhance the world's most important grape varietals	26	Glassware, Riedel, 'O' Series
172	1	172	Claus Riedel pioneered the practice of tailoring the shape of a wine glass to the specific characteristics of the wine it's made to hold. The Riedel Ouverture series are the ideal all purpose glasses for everyday use. The collection offers perfectly shaped wine glasses at competitive prices. The Ouverture series is made from lead free crystal.	26	Glassware, Riedel, Ouverture
173	1	173	The Riedel Wine Series was created for customers who feel that plain stemware on a well laid table is just not decorative enough. The collection combines a light catching, decorative stem and Vinum's most popular bowls. Made from lead free crystal, the Wine Series is both attractive and affordably priced.	26	Glassware, Riedel, Wine Series
175	1	175	Riedel Vinum was the first machine-made series of glasses in history based exclusively on the characteristics of grape varietals. Vinum has had a permanent impact on the globe's wine culture. These glasses have proved that the pleasures of consuming wine start with the glass.

178	1	178	Decanters combine sophistication and elegance with optimal shapes for aeration. Decanting old wines, just a few moments before they are served, helps to ensure that the wines' clarity and brilliance are not obscured by any deposit that may have developed over time. Decanting young wines several hours before they are served gives the wine a chance to bloom and attain a stage of development that normally requires years of aging.	26	Glassware, Riedel, Decanters

Due to the extreme heat that could adversely affect wine while in transit, Wine.com will suggest several weather safe options for you.  These options are presented in the final stage of the shopping cart before you place your order.</p> <p>Primarily, in the summer, we recommend the following options:</p> <ol> <li>Choose Next Day Air and use the shipping calendar to select a date and address where someone will be there to sign for the package on the first attempt.</li> <li>Choose a future delivery date after the summer.  Our calendar will allow you to choose a date up to six months from now.  In these cases, Wine.com will store your wine in our temperature controlled warehouse and will ship it to arrive on the future date you select.</li> <li>Choose the Hold Until Safe option.  In this case, we will watch the weather closely and will remove the hold and ship your order as soon as conditions permit. The release dates will vary, and in some of the hottest states, that may mean waiting until October. But, if there is an unusual cool break, the warehouses will ship. If the Hold Until Safe option is released and your order is shipped, you will receive a shipping notice with the tracking number link.</li> </ol> </div> <div data-role="collapsible"> <h3>How can I check the status of a placed order?</h3> <p>Once you have placed an order you can track its status by visiting your account and clicking your orders.  Once an order ships the tracking number will appear and you can click it for more detailed status updates from the carrier.</p> </div> </div>	24	Mobile Help page.

196	1	195	<a name="whatis"></a> 										<p><span class="orangethirtbold">Q. What is a wine club?</span></p> 										<p><span class="orangethirtbold">A.</span> Wine Clubs are a monthly subscription where members receive 2 bottles of wine each month, delivered to your door.  Wines are selected by our staff Wine Experts, who provide tasting notes, suggested food pairings, and information about the wineries and regions related to each wine. Wine Club members also receive discounts and special offers from Wine.com.</p> 										<p>Whether for your personal enjoyment or sent as a gift, Wine Clubs are a fun and convenient way for wine enthusiasts or wine beginners to explore the world of wine.</p> 										<a name="whyshould"></a> 										<p><span class="orangethirtbold">Q.  Why should I join a Wine Club?</span></p> 										<p><span class="orangethirtbold">A.</span> A. Wine clubs are a convenient and enjoyable way to educate yourself on a variety of wines and the regions from which they come.  Choosing wines from a store can be overwhelming so wine clubs make the selection for you.  Each month's wines are selected through individual tastings by our Wine Experts to ensure quality and value.  Our wines are not private label wines; they come from real wineries that are highly acclaimed or soon-to-be discovered.  We want you to find these wines again on a restaurant list and recommend them to others.  Wine Clubs are empowering and educational!</p> 										<p>Visit our <a href="/wineclubs/default.asp">club pages</a> for a list of all member benefits.</p> 										<a name="cani"></a> 										<p><span class="orangethirtbold">Q. Can I reorder wines sent in club shipments?</span></p> 										<p><span class="orangethirtbold">A.</span> Yes, you may reorder any of your Wine Club wines as long as supplies last - and Wine Club members receive 15% off wines sent in a recent club shipment.  We encourage you to sample your two wines and reorder within 30 days for best availability.</p> 										<a name="cangift"></a> 										<p><span class="orangethirtbold">Q. Can I send a Wine Club as a gift?</span></p> 										<p><span class="orangethirtbold">A.</span> Yes.  Our prepaid memberships were created for convenient gift giving, with 3, 6 and 12 month subscriptions available.  Gift recipients receive all member benefits for the length of their membership. During your order, please be sure to provide an email address for any gift recipient to ensure their access to all member benefits and important tracking information.</p> 										<p>Also, please be sure to provide a shipping address where a recipient at least 21 years of age is present to sign for deliveries, as is the law for shipments of alcohol.</p> 										<a name="whatdiff"></a> 										<p><span class="orangethirtbold">Q. What is the difference between month-to-month and prepaid memberships?</span></p> 										<p><span class="orangethirtbold">A.</span>  Month-to-month memberships have no end date and are paid each month as the order ships. Shipping and handling is added to the price of each month's shipment.</p> 										<p>Prepaid memberships - which are ideal for gifts! - are purchased with a single initial payment for a 3, 6 or 12 month duration. These memberships include shipping and handling in their price.</p> 										<a name="whenhow"></a> 										<p><span class="orangethirtbold">Q. When and how does billing occur?</span></p> 										<p><span class="orangethirtbold">A.</span>  Month-to-month members are charged for each club installment as it is shipped. Charges are applied to the credit card associated with the subscription. Prepaid members are charged in full at the time of purchase</p> 										<a name="whattime"></a> 										<p><span class="orangethirtbold">Q. What time of the month do Wine Club shipments arrive?</span></p> 										<p><span class="orangethirtbold">A.</span>  Wine Clubs are processed and shipped during the middle two weeks of each month but no later than the 25th and arrive within 3-5 business days. December shipments are sent early to avoid holiday delivery delays.  The first shipment of a new membership is sent within a few days of the order.</p> 										<a name="canhave"></a> 										<p><span class="orangethirtbold">Q. Can I have shipments delivered at home or at work?</span></p> 										<p><span class="orangethirtbold">A.</span>  Yes, you may ship to a home or place of business.  We strongly suggest shipping to a place of business.

After the actual manufacturing process, the glasses undergo an oxygenizing treatment which gives the Breathable Glasses its unique properties. Vino Nobile is the starter series into the world of breathable beverage-specific glasses.	26	Glassware, Eisch Vino Nobile
201	1	200	The Vintec series, created with Eisch’s breathable glass technology, is characterized by its avant-garde design. The large contact area between wine and atmospheric oxygen at the bottom of the glass provide optimum development possibilities for the wine. The glasses are handmade in lead-free dishwasher safe crystal.	26	Glassware, Eisch Vintec
202	1	201	The Ronn R. Wiegand series was co-created by Ronn R. Wiegand, Master of Wine and Master Sommelier, and Eisch Glaskultur.  This breathable series reflects the elegance, grace and strength of the greatest wines from around the world, and will be a beautiful addition to any table. The glasses are handmade in lead-free dishwasher safe crystal.	26	Glassware, Eisch R. Wiegand
203	1	202	<p><strong>Variety</strong><br> This refers to the particular grape that makes up the wine. Though you would not necessarily know it from the label, this wine is made up from 100% Chardonnay grapes. "Chablis" actually refers to the region (appellation) where the grapes were harvested. In "Old World" (European) wines, the appellation is the most important factor in the choice of wine as opposed to the varietal.</p> <p><strong>Estate Bottling</strong><br> "Mis en Bouteille" means the wine has been bottled at the estate where the grapes were grown and made into wine. Its American equivalent is "Grown, Produced, and Bottled by." American wines can also be "Produced and Bottled by," signifying that the grapes were purchased from elsewhere, but the wine is made by the winery. However, wine labeled as "Made and Bottled by" a winery generally means that the wine was probably bought in bulk and merely bottled at the winery.</p> <p><strong>Producer</strong><br> This is usually the winery, but it can range from small growers who make and bottle their own wine to large corporations who buy in bulk and merely bottle the wine. This can also be a brand name that does not refer directly to any real entity and is used for marketing purposes. The producer is usually the largest text on the label and the easiest element to identify. Albert Pic & Fils is the producer for this wine.</p> <p><strong>Winery Info</strong><br> This provides a very brief description of the winery or producer such as historical background, physical location, and date of establishment. Appellation or Region This refers to the geographical location where the grapes were grown. In the United States, these are legally defined AVAs, American Viticultural Areas. Some are as broad as "California," while some are as narrowly defined as a section of a river valley. In the US, vineyards can be named, but law does not regulate the use of these names as in many European Countries. In France, the legally defined area is called an Appellation d'Origine Controlee. The appellation can be as broad as a country or, unlike the US, can be as specific as a particular vineyard. Chablis is the appellation for this wine.</p> <p><strong>Alcohol Content</strong><br> The alcohol content of a wine can range from a low of about 7% in a light German Riesling to about 17% in a monster late harvest Zinfandel. Fortified wines can go up to 21%. Most wines, however, have between 11% and 14%.</p> <p><strong>Importer</strong><br> Often the importer's name is on the label or on a strip just below the label. In most situations this isn't terribly significant. Some enthusiasts have learned, though, that the taste of certain importers corresponds closely to their tastes. In this case, knowing something about the importer can help you determine whether you would like an otherwise unknown wine. Kobrand is the importer of this wine. </p>	24	NULL

222	1	227	<p>If you've ever attended a "serious" wine tasting, you may have noticed people milling about with what looked like a stemmed fish bowl clutched in their hands. No, they're not taking their pet guppy for a walk, they're just especially picky about the sort of glass they use for tasting.   <p>Wine glasses do come in a variety of shapes and sizes, and while personal preference certainly plays a role, there is rhyme, and even reason, to the choices. For example, champagne is served in a tall, narrow flute because the shape helps to preserve a sparkler's mousse, that fine stream of beautiful, tiny bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass, as well as its bouquet.   <p>At the opposite end of the shape spectrum, a Burgundy glass typically has a tapered balloon shape, which helps accent all of the wonderful complexities and nuanced aromas of a fine Pinot Noir. A must for Burgundy lovers - and not quite as cumbersome as that fish bowl! ; >)   <p>All you really need to enjoy wine is a wine glass, preferably uncut crystal, that offers refined durability. Crystal shows off a wine's color and clarity, and that can tell you a lot about the wine's age, condition and intensity. The glass should have a long enough stem that your hand need not grip the bowl, and the bowl's rim should be thin enough so that you'll notice the wine and not the glass's density.   <p>As your personal taste migrates toward a particular wine variety, you may want to invest in the style and shape of glass best suited to that preference. But if you're like me, and prefer to enjoy a wide variety of wines, an all-purpose glass works just fine.   <p>We offer several styles of genuine crystal stemware from Riedel and Stoelzle-Oberglas. These imported wine glasses combine strength and quality, and will get you through many years of spirited toasts to life, love, and of course, great wine! You can find our glasses in the Accessories Shop.	24	NULL

227	1	231	Regions are the countries or states that produce wine. Most regions are very large, like California or Australia.Most regions are broken down into smaller sub-regions, which we call appellations.	26	About Regions, Advanced Search
228	1	232	Appellations are smaller, more distinct wine-growing areas within a larger region. Appellation is a general term taken from the French wine classification system. Wines from appellations often have a specific style because they come from a smaller place.	26	About Appellations, Advanced Search
229	1	233	Vintage --------------------  This is the year in which the grapes were harvested.   Vintage variation has lost much of its importance in selecting a wine due to modern winemaking techniques.   Nowadays, undrinkable wine is exceedingly rare and because of these advances, the producer is now a more important factor when choosing a wine.   1996 is the Vintage of this wine.	24	NULL

European labels, however, rarely carry the varietal information as the appellation is most important consideration.    In the rest of the world, varietal labeling has become the dominant way producers and consumers discuss wine.   In most countries, laws dictate that at least 75% of the wine is made from the named grape variety.	24	NULL

259	1	260	<b>EVINEYARD.COM SIGNS YEAR-LONG CHARTER SPONSORSHIP OF SALON.COM'S TRAVEL & FOOD SITE</b> <br> <em>Innovative convergence package features wine advertising throughout Salon.com's media properties</em> <b>San Francisco - March 22, 2000</b> -- Today, Salon.com (Nasdaq: SALN; www.salon.com) , one of the leading Internet media companies, announced a major sponsorship agreement with eVineyard.com, a leading online retailer of fine wines. eVineyard has become the exclusive wine partner for Salon Travel & Food, one of the 11 sites on the Salon.com Web network, and the premier sponsor for Burt Wolf's weekly column of travel and culinary dispatches from around the world. Financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed.  Under the agreement, eVineyard will also be a premier advertiser on a number of Salon.com's convergence initiatives, including "Burt Wolf: Travels & Traditions," the PBS television series for which Salon.com is the parent sponsor. In addition, eVineyard has agreed to participate in a number of Salon.com's events. Last month, the wine retailer co-sponsored the Salon Politics2000 launch party held in Washington and broadcast live on C-Span, the public affairs cable network.  "eVineyard is an ideal wine partner for Salon.com's upscale, mass-market audience," said Michael O'Donnell, CEO and president of Salon.com. "eVineyard executives immediately recognized the opportunities in Salon.com's innovative, multifaceted campaign across our various media properties. The program goes way beyond the banner ad to create a more effective convergence model."   In January, Salon.com announced it was teaming up with travel and food personality Burt Wolf, author or editor of more than 60 books and host of popular travel programs on PBS, CNN and the Discovery Channel. At that time, Wolf began a weekly column for Salon Travel & Food and Salon.com became the sponsor of Wolf's 13-episode television series for PBS, "Burt Wolf: Travels & Traditions," debuting later this year. Salon.com has sold two 15-second sponsorship acknowledgements to eVineyard on each of the 13 episodes as part of the convergence package announced today.  "We're excited to be associated with both Salon.com, a benchmark Internet brand, and Burt Wolf, a renowned name in food and travel," added Larry Gerhard, CEO of eVineyard. "When we were looking for the best demographics and quality content to generate sales, Salon.com was the natural choice."  "We are aggregating the best brands for our users who shop online and eVineyard has clearly established itself as the premier wine destination on the Web," added Michael O'Donnell.  eVineyard offers the industry's largest online selection of premium wine products as well as rich editorial content, a wine club for gift-giving and an informational community experience. In addition, the retailer is an anchor tenant in NBC Internet's shopping area (formerly Snap.com).  About Salon.com Salon.com (Nasdaq:SALN; www.salon.com; AOL Keyword: Salon) is an Internet media company that produces a network of 11 award-winning, original content sites and hosts two communities: Table Talk and The WELL. The site was founded in 1995 by David Talbot, former arts editor of the San Francisco Examiner. Salon.com currently has relationships with more than 325 advertisers including industry leaders such as IBM, Lexus, Microsoft, EDS, Virgin Megastore Online and Intel. In December 1999, Salon.com announced a content and equity agreement with Rainbow Media Holdings, Inc., a subsidiary of Cablevision Systems Corp. and NBC. Strategic distribution partners include America Online (AOL), Lycos, Go.com, AltaVista, Reuters, CNN.com and CNet as well as wireless innovators AvantGo and Rocket eBooks. Salon.com content is also syndicated to print publications through United Features Syndicate. The site had 3.4 million unique visitors in December 1999.  About eVineyard.com Based in Portland, Ore., eVineyard offers the Web's largest selection of premium domestic and imported wines available.

383	1	348	<p> Varietal is one word you'll see applied to most non-European wines; it simply refers to the grape variety used to make the wine. In Europe, the finest wines are usually named after the region (the other is appellation) in which the grapes are grown; examples include Bordeaux, Chianti, Piesporter, Champagne, etc.  In most of the rest of the world (including Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, South America and the United States) the finest wines are usually labeled with the name of the grape variety that the wine is made from (i.e.: Cabernet, Chardonnay, etc.).  The Europeans have had hundreds of  years to determine which grapes grow best in which regions, and they often have regulations controlling their labeling.  For example, Pinot Noir is the only red grape allowed to be grown in most of the Burgundy region.  As non-European countries establish reputations for the wines of certain regions, they often add the region's name to the varietal name; for example, Napa  Valley Cabernet, Russian River Pinot Noir.  </p> <p> Serious wine-producing countries and states regulate the amount of a particular grape that must be present before the wine can flaunt that grape's name. In California and Washington any wine referred to by the name of the grape (Chardonnay, for example) must be at least 75% of that grape; most varietals in Oregon must be 90% of the named grape; and Alsace requires 100%.   </p> <p> The types of grapes used to make a wine are probably the single most important factor in the taste of the wine.  However, the flavors of a wine are also affected by how old the vines are, what types of soils the vines are grown in, exposure to sunlight, climates and microclimates, how the grapes are handled and fermented, types of yeast used, whether the wine is aged in wood, etc. Therefore, the same grape types can be grown in France, Australia, California and Chile, but various factors result in wines which taste different!  Half the fun of experiencing wine is the incredible array of flavors available! </p> <p> Many of the world's finest wines are a blend of varietals: almost all Bordeaux red wines contain Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc; almost all Champagnes contain Pinot Noir and Chardonnay.  A wine which is a blend of Cabernet and Merlot, for example, is often more complex than a wine which is 100% Cabernet Sauvignon.  Exploring varietal characteristics makes for a richer wine experience. To that end, we have collected descriptions of the varietals you are most likely to encounter. </p>	24	NULL

402	1	362	<p  class="header"> Ratings Explained </p> <p> As always, our goal is to help you choose the wines that would make you happiest. To give you a balance of information, Wine.com displays ratings from five different publications- Wine Spectator, Wine Enthusiast, Wines & Spirits, Steven Tanzer's International Wine Cellar and the Wine Advocate. While ratings may influence your decision, the ultimate judgment is yours.  </p> <p> Wine.com is not sponsored by, affiliated or associated with <i>Wine Spectator</i>, <i>Wines & Spirits</i> <i>Wine Enthusiast</i>, <i>Steven Tanzer's International Wine Cellar</i> or <i>Wine Advocate</i> and their publishers.  </p> <p class="subheader"> <b>Wine Spectator</b> </p> <p> The beauty of this system is that each wine region is the sole jurisdiction of one Editor who has, after much time and grueling research, developed an expertise in that region's offerings. During a tasting, other editors are on hand and can certainly offer opinions, but the final say is had by that main Editor.  </p> <p> All tastings are conducted "blind." Tasters are told only the general type of wine (varietal or region) and the vintage. If a wine tastes corky or flawed in a major way, or if it scores  below 70, a new bottle of the same wine is tasted again. By the same token, wines that score very highly are re-tasted to confirm such favorable first impressions.  </p> <p> European wines are tasted in the districts that yield them, where fresher, perfectly stored  examples will be readily available. Ratings are based on how good a wine will be when it  reaches its peak, regardless of how soon that will be. If barrel samples are being rated  rather than finished wines, that is revealed, since a world of difference can exist between  these two stages of a wine's life. </p> <p> Following is <I>Wine Spectator's</I> 100-Point Scale and what it indicates:<br> <b>95-100</b> -- Classic; a great wine <br> <b>90-94</b> -- Outstanding; superior character and style <br> <b>80-89</b> -- Good to very good; wine with special qualities <br> <b>70-79</b> -- Average; drinkable wine that may have minor flaws <br> <b>60-69</b> -- Below average; drinkable but not recommended <br> <b>50-59</b> -- Poor; undrinkable, not recommended <br> </p> <p class="subheader"> <b>Wine Advocate</b> </p> <p> Robert Parker is a renowned wine critic and publisher of <I>Wine Advocate</I>.  He was made a  Chevalier (one of France's two presidential honors) in 1993 to honor his work. <I>Wine Advocate</I> is a well-established source for wine consumers worldwide. To generate ratings, Parker spends three months each year tasting in vineyards. He devotes the other nine months of the year solely to tasting and writing. The ratings, which are based on a 50-100 point quality scale, reflect his independent, very critical look at wine.  </p> <p> Tastings are conducted in peer group, single-blind conditions , which means the same types of wines are tasted against each other and the wineries' names are not revealed. Therefore, neither price nor the reputation of the winery influences the rating in any way. As many of the wines rated have been tasted several times, the scores represent a cumulative average of the wine's performance in tastings to date. Overall, the score assigned to a specific wine reflects the quality of the wine at its best. </p> <p> With the <I>Wine Advocate</I> scoring system, each wine starts with a base of 50 points. The wine's general color and appearance merit up to 5 points. Because most wines are well made due to steady advancements in modern technology, they generally receive from 4 to 5 points. The aroma and bouquet merit up to 15 points, which is based on the intensity level and dimension of the aroma and bouquet as well as the cleanliness of the wine. Flavor and finish merit up to 20 points and, again, intensity of flavor, balance, cleanliness, depth and length on the palate are all important considerations when awarding points. Finally, the overall quality level or potential for further evolution and improvement-aging merits up to 10 points. </p> <p> Following is <i>Wine Advocate</i>'s 100-Point Scale and what it indicates:<br> <b>96-100</b>-- Extraordinary; a classic wine of its variety<br> <b>90-95</b> -- Outstanding; exceptional complexity and character<br> <b>80-89</b> -- Barely above average to very good; wine with various    degrees of flavor<br> <b>70-79</b> -- Average; little distinction beyond being soundly made<br> <b>60-69</b> -- Below average; drinkable, but containing noticeable  deficiencies<br> <b>50-59</b> -- Poor; unacceptable, not recommended </p> <p class="subheader"> <b>Wine Enthusiast</b> </p> <p> <i>Wine Enthusiast</i> ratings are based on tastings by the magazine's editors and other qualified tasting panelists, either individually or in a group setting. Tastings are conducted blind or in accordance with accepted industry practices. Price is not a factor in assigning scores to wines. Only wines scoring 80 points or higher are rated. When possible, wines considered flawed or uncustomary are retasted to confirm intitial impressions.  </p> <p> About the <i>Wine Enthusiast</i> Scores<br> Ratings reflect editors' conclusions regarding a particular wine.<br> <b>95-100</b> -- Superb. One of the greats.<br> <b>90-94</b> -- Excellent. Extremely well made and highly recommended.<br> <b>85-89</b> -- Very good. May offer outstanding value if the price is right.<br> <b>80-84</b> -- Good.

403	1	363	<p class="header"> Pairing Food & Wine </p> <p> <b>True or False:</b> White wine is to be drunk with white meats and fish, red wine goes with beef, and sweet wines go with desserts, period, and to do it any other way is courting a visit from the Wine Police. </p> <p> <img src="images/wineandfood.jpg" height="202" width="136" align="right" valign="top"> The answer is False, but the truth is that until a couple decades ago this is how people decided what to drink with dinner.   Thankfully, our minds have broadened. The current thinking is that since food can be every bit as complex as wine, the options for creating rich pairings are staggering.   And it cannot be stressed enough: a successful pairing is one that you find pleasing -- maybe nobody else on the planet likes Champagne with liverwurst, but you happen to find the combination absolutely transporting.  </p> <p> If there is a rule of thumb it would be either to go for complementary flavors or flavors that contrast.  For example, a dish with citrus would be complemented by a fruity wine; a hearty stew would go well with a full-bodied wine; and a delicately flavored dish, such as poached sole, would be in good company with a dry, crisp wine. Whereas a rich cream sauce would contrast nicely with a highly acidic dry wine; and a simple snack of bread and cheese would turn positively ambrosial when paired with a complex full-bodied red.  The best advice of all is to experiment, open-mindedly, and frequently. </p> <p> What follows are some truths about how wine can react with food:  <ul> <li>A wine high in tannins (Bordeaux, for instance) mated with a food high in tannins (like walnuts) will render the wine almost undrinkably dry and astringent. <li>Protein tends to calm tannins, so a very tannic wine might be rendered glorious when enjoyed with rare beef. <li>Delicate foods - veal, or filet of sole for example - will be overwhelmed by a full-bodied red wine.  By the same token, a hearty lasagna will virtually cancel out a dry, medium-bodied Sauvignon Blanc. <li>A wine can add its primary flavor to a dish, giving food a layer it didn't start out with.  <li>Some wine and food combinations result in a flavor that was not present in either one and is not meant to be, metal for instance.  Try white turkey meat with red Bordeaux if you doubt this. <li>Sometimes it's as though this wine has been searching all its life for this food and fireworks ensue.   <li>Tannic wines make sweet foods taste less sweet; salty foods emphasize tannin. <li>Salty foods mute the sweetness and enhance the fruitiness of a sweet wine. <li>Wines that are high in acid taste less acidic with salty or sweet  food; acidic wines also can offset oily foods. </ul> <span class="bodytext">Remember - any combination you enjoy is a good combination!	24	NULL
404	1	364	<p class="header">Hosting a Tasting Party</p> <p> What better way to learn about wine than with your friends in your own home? The most important element to a successful tasting is to keep the mood light and fun. Remember that one of the main goals of wine tasting is to find a wine you enjoy drinking, and not necessarily to dissect it to its minutest parts. </p> <p> Here are a few necessary ingredients:<br> <ul> <li><a href="/shop/product_list.asp?type=varietal,501">Glasses</a> <li><a href="tastingnotesform.htm" target="_new">Note sheets</a> / <a href="/product/display.asp?Product_ID=9472">journal</a> and pens for taking notes <li> Crackers, cheese, and fruit <li> Drinking water and water to rinse glasses  <li> Spit buckets (your choice)  <li> White tablecloth or background for observing wine color </ul> </span> </p> <p><span class="bodytext"> There are a number of themes for your tasting party, here are a few of our favorites:</span> </p> <ul> <li>A <b>horizontal tasting</b> is where different wines of the same vintage (year) are tasted.  This is a good way of determining which producer or vineyard you prefer. <li>A <b>vertical tasting</b> is the same wine from different vintages.  This is where vintage variations and the effects of bottle aging are clearly seen.  An example would be to compare a '94 pinot noir against a '97 pinot noir from the same winery. <li>A fun way to test your knowledge of varieties (cabernet, pinot noir, zinfandel, etc.) is to <b>disguise the bottles</b> and have the tasters guess the variety based on the aroma, color, and taste of the wine. <li>Another fun tasting is a <b>"stand off"</b> where wines of one variety and region are paired against wines of the same variety but from a different region.  (For example: Bordeaux from France vs. the Cabernets of California or Shiraz from Australia vs. Syrahs from Rhone.) <li>A good way to test whether a wine is appropriately priced is to purchase wines of the same variety but with <b>widely varying prices</b>, cover the labels, have the tasting, and then see if the reviews reflect the cost of the wine.   </ul> </p> <p class="subheader"> <b>Tasting techniques:</b> </p> <p><span class="bodytext"> First, notice the color of the wine as you tilt your glass to see the wine from its very thinnest and lightest to its deepest color. <br><br> Second, gently swirl the wine inside the bowl of the glass to coat the sides.  Notice how quickly or slowly the wine filters down after you stop swirling.  (These rivulets are called "legs.")  Then lift the glass to your nose to inhale the aroma and take note of what scent first makes itself known to you. <br><br> Third, take a drink and slosh the wine throughout your mouth. This method helps to bring the wine to all parts of the mouth and tongue, allowing each taste sensation to be detected. You may have seen tasters take air in through the mouth; this further intensifies the flavors and enhances the interpretation. <br><br> Lastly, take note of how long the flavor of the wine stays in your mouth. This is referred to as the "finish," and will leave the last impression of the wine with you.</span> </p> <p class="subheader"> <b>Helpful tips:</b> </p> <ul> <li>It might be easier for beginners to describe wines in terms of personality (e.g. bold, complex, reserved, subtle, etc.) instead of by flavor.   <li>White wines demonstrate their full flavor at temperatures between 50-60 degrees Farenheit.  (That's about 45 minutes in the fridge prior to serving.) </ul>	24	NULL
405	1	365	<p>Wine Questions and Answers (text_id is 365)</p>	24	NULL
406	1	366	<p> The term appellation is French and refers to a viticultural region distinguished by geographical features which produce wines with shared characteristics. The idea is that the soil, climate, sun, water quality, and contour of a region combine to produce a style of wine that simply can't be duplicated elsewhere. The size of an appellation can range from very small plots of land to huge areas that cover hundreds of miles.  </p> <p> American wines emphasize varietal over place but European winemakers take the opposite approach. In 1935 France founded the Institute National Des Appellations d'Origine, becoming the first nation to set up a countrywide system based on geography for controlling the origin and quality of its wines. Their Appellation d'Origine Controlee (AOC) plan originated as a preventative measure during the Depression to protect French winemakers and consumers from fraudulent and inferior wine blending practices of some unethical French wine brokers. Since that time other countries have adopted similar regulatory controls.  </p> <p> In the U.S. appellations are known as American Viticultural Areas or AVAs. However, the American Viticultural Area carries a different connotation than the French appellation of origin. Labels, for instance, may identify a wine's AVA when a minimum of 85% of the grapes used comes from within that specified AVA, while French AOC regulations have stricter guidelines which include vineyard location, varietal, growing technique, crop yield, grape ripeness and ensuing alcohol content, and winemaking practices.  </p> <p> As a rule, the French rely more on terrain and the manifestation of nature upon grapes than do Americans. It's the basis upon which the entire French wine classification is built, after all. However, American wine enthusiasts also recognize how powerful a tool regional flavors and style characteristics are for wine identification and classification. To illustrate, a wine that's labeled simply California Chardonnay could emanate from anywhere in California rather than in the Sonoma-Napa County wine region. </p> <p> In essence, wine-tasting is the study of how soil, climate, and weather affect different varieties of grapes, and how those factors are manifested in wine. So, the next time you enjoy a robust Zinfandel, pay attention to where it comes from, and later select another label from that same appellation. You should notice some subtle characteristics the two wines have in common. With your new-found knowledge, you'll be able try wines from the same appellation with some degree of assurance that they will suit your taste, even if the brand is unfamiliar. </p>	24	NULL
407	1	367	<p> There is no such thing as a "typical" winery. They run the gamut from tiny boutiques using rented equipment and producing a few thousand bottles to huge commercial enterprises which operate like factories. One trait they all have in common, however, is their flexibility. Most try to keep their options open in order to adapt to today's market -- handling a number of types of grapes from various sources and turning them into a variety of wines. The best wineries limit themselves to half a dozen bottles or less. Specialization is definitely on the increase.  </p>	24	NULL

439	1	396	<p class="header">How to Taste Wine</p> <p> Professional wine tasters do not treat the process casually.  Maybe it's not even fun at times, since they have to dissect, in minutest detail, every sip of every wine.  It's their job.  You, on the other hand, are not accountable to anybody but yourself. The degree of seriousness aside, there are some key factors one looks for in assessing wine. You certainly don't have to like what is considered excellent wine, but you should have an appreciation for why it is considered such.  Also, it makes drinking better wines a much deeper, richer experience.    </p> <p> There are several kinds of tasting.  One is for people who barely know the difference between red and white - uncommon but not unheard of.  In this case, choose five bottles, a light young red, a mature red, a dry white, a sweet white, and a port or sherry.   For a more discerning group, choose five different varietals, like a Zinfandel, Pinot Noir, Cabernet, Merlot and Syrah, to illuminate the distinct differences in so-called &quot;red&quot; wines.  Another method might be to select Chardonnays from as many different growing regions as is practical (include several countries and states) to determine what the &quot;baseline Chardonnay&quot; taste is, and how that taste can vary depending upon where it's grown.  This is a delightful way to explore a single varietal in depth. </p> <p> For the more serious taster there are horizontal and vertical tastings.  Horizontal would be, for example, ten Cabernets from the same year but different wineries; vertical means all the Cabernets are from different years.   This give insight as to what constitutes an excellent Cabernet - again, in your opinion. </p> <p> You can taste blind -- without seeing the labels --  or in full view of the facts.  Blind tasting insures you are not swayed by a wine's reputation.  You'll detect what you're supposed to detect, not what you think you're supposed to detect.   In blind tasting competitions, the object is to guess correctly the wine and the vintage, and the best team wins.  In competitive tastings wine against wine, such as pitting Cabernets from California against Bordeaux from France, the tasting is done blind to insure a fair out come - so the more established reputation of the Bordeaux  region doesn't wield more clout than it deserves to.  </p> <p> When several wines are being tasted, the order should be youngest and lightest wines first followed by older more full-bodied ones.  To reverse this order is to overwhelm any subtleties a younger, lighter wine might have accrued and is not a fair assessment. </p> <p> And what are you looking for in evaluating wine?  Appearance first, then smell, impression in the mouth, total flavor in the mouth, and aftertaste. </p> <p> Appearance consists of a wine's clarity and its color.   As red wines age they fade, going from deep purple to, eventually, a brick color, whereas white wines grow darker.  The best way to judge color is against a white background, a tablecloth or piece of paper, with not a lot of wine in the glass.  Also part of a wine's appearance is the wine's viscosity or &quot;legs,&quot; which run down the sides of the glass when it is swirled.  The more slow moving the legs, the denser the flavor.  So if a red wine is pale to brickish and has slow moving legs you can expect it to be mature. </p> <p> Our centers for smell are located right next to our memory centers.  One good whiff of a wine that has been swirled in the glass a couple times should evoke distinct memories -  of honey, flowers, mushrooms, citrus, butter, for example -  it will also remind you that you've had this wine before, or alert you to the vinegary or moldy scent of a bad wine.  First impressions are crucial here and far more reliable than subsequent sniffs.   Based on appearance and smell, you now have enough information to determine a wine's overall quality and age. </p> <p> Tasting the wine fills in some blanks, mainly with regard to a wine's &quot;balance.&quot;  Take a generous sip and swirl it in your mouth.  The weight of the wine in your mouth will tell you whether it's light-, medium- or full-bodied.  It  also tells you how much sweetness, acidity, alcohol and tannin it contains.  The object is for these elements to harmonize pleasantly.  If one element is dominant, a proficient taster will know whether that imbalance is a flaw, or is  acceptable in the wine being tasted.  (A young red wine might be overly tannic but with definite fruitiness, suggesting that in a few years the tannin will have been moderated by the fruit; in this case too much tannin is perfectly acceptable.) The ultimate moment in tasting is just before the wine is swallowed, when the vapors hit the upper nasal cavities.   </p> <p> In France, the concept of aftertaste  has been quantified in the form of a &quot;caudalie.&quot;  If the flavor of the wine stays in your mouth after swallowing for one second, that wine has achieved one caudalie.   The more caudalies the better, especially with the wines of Burgundy. Really good wines make the strongest impressions with their smell and their aftertaste. </p> <p> If you're a professional taster, or if the information obtained is to be used for any important purpose, like a wine review, you should spit out each sip.  Not as much fun, for sure, but it does make for a clear head. </p> <p> Finally, it's a good idea to keep notes about the wines you taste so you can enjoy - or steer clear of - those precise wines again, or so you can  get wines with similar characteristics.  And feel free to develop your own rating system.  Professional ratings are very helpful in a broad sense but they can't compare to what you think about a wine. </p> <p> At some point you may want to take an actual wine tasting class -- talk to your local wine shop for recommendations!! </p>	24	NULL

Guests from around the country make the annual pilgrimage to the Celebration, anxious to take advantage of the fine wines, great foods, original music and special events that are a hallmark of this Labor Day extravaganza.	24	NULL
444	1	399	In 1797, during the Mission Period in California, grape growing was introduced to the West Coast and showed how widespread the area was for viticulture. The planting of the first vineyards in the area took place at Mission San Jose.<br><br> The secularization of the California missions in 1834 and 1835 reduced Church land holdings to the area immediately around the church proper. This opened a great deal of land in the Livermore Valley to settlement by Mexican government land grant. One of the grantees was Robert Livermore and he called his grant in the southeast corner of the Valley, Rancho Las Positas. The first acknowledged vineyard in Livermore Valley was planted by Livermore about 1846. He planted the Mission grape and likely used the same methods employed by the Spanish padres for making wine, although he probably used barrels as fermenting tanks. To commemorate his first harvest, the Livermore Valley marks 1849 as its first vintage year.<br><br> Several significant growers and producers in the early years of Livermore Valley include: Charles Wetmore, California's viticultural pioneer who led an early generation of vintners to the Livermore Valley; Carl Heinrich Wente, he quickly established a reputation for good wines. There was also James Concannon, a pioneer in the rubber stamp business. From the sale of rubber stamps, Concannon earned enough money to buy his vineyard property of 47 acres in August 183. Assured of a steady market for sacramental wines, he specialized in white wines, (Semillon and Sauvignon Blanc) since they do not stain the altar.<br><br> When the Livermore Valley Wine Country first harvested wines in 1849, no one could have predicted the beginning of a world-class wine region. More than 150 years later, the vintages of the Livermore Valley have captured attention the world over. Today the Tri-Valley area which includes the cities of Livermore, Pleasanton, San Ramon and Dublin presents a rich diversity of commerce with top Fortune 500 companies, mixed with the wine producing region that continues to preserve the area's historic roots. The next time you visit the Livermore Valley be sure to enjoy the many amenities and see what the Tri-Valley has to offer.	24	NULL

During account creation a user is required to give their name, date of birth, email address, zip code, and a password of 5-16 characters in length. This information is used to contact the user about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest. It is optional for the user to provide a phone number, but encouraged so we can have another means to contact you should any reason arise regarding an order.  <br><br> <b>Ordering</b><br>  We request information from the user on our order form. Here a user must provide contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial information (credit card number, expiration date, billing address, and billing phone number). This information is used for billing purposes to verify the customer is of legal age, and to fill customers' orders.

Any information placed in the cookie is accessible ONLY to eVineyard, and will NOT be sold or shared with anyone else under any circumstances. We use a cookie to store a unique session identifier, and this allows us to maintain your shopping cart and state selection from one page request to the next. We are also able to maintain your session information from one visit to the next. By setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still browse our site. Unfortunately, the user experience will be greatly curtailed and only the California catalog will be available. In addition, the user will be unable to log in or make a purchase. Cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site and show you the products that your order history indicates you prefer.  <br><br> <b>Log Files</b><br> We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.  <br><br> <b>Sharing</b><br> We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.  <br><br> We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.  <br><br> We value your privacy very much at eVineyard, Inc., and will never release any account information to anyone outside of the necessary core groups that help our business function, like those mentioned above unless our customers give us the authority to do so.  <br><br> <b>Links</b><br>  This web site contains links to other sites.

469	1	420	<br><br> <b>Surveys & Contests</b><br> From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. This information may be used for marketing opportunities by eVineyard, Inc. if authorized by the registrant, and will also be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.  <br><br> <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tr><td valign="bottom"><b>Security</b></td><td><img hspace="10" src="/cs/images/logo_verisignBtm.gif"></td></tr></table> When our order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL (Secure Socket Layers), provided by VeriSign, the premier encryption software company available today. While on a secure page such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'.  <br><br> While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information offline. All of our users' information, like the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. If one of these people leaves their workstation, they are required to lock their station until they return. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up to date on our security and privacy practices.  <br><br> Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance of keeping our customers' information secure and safe at all times. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a locked and secure environment.  <br><br> If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to <a href="mailto:customercare@wine.com">customercare@wine.com</a>.  <br><br> <b>Correcting/Updating Personal Information</b><br>  If your personally identifiable information changes (such as your shipping or billing address, your preferred credit card, etc.), you can add new information or delete any addresses or credit cards from your account at the Order Summary page of our site. You can also modify your login information and opt out of our newsletter from the "My Account" link at the bottom of any page on our site. Of course, if you prefer the personal touch, we offer live one-on-one help toll-free by phone at (877) 289-6886, where a cheery voice will be happy to help.  <br><br> <b>Sale of Our Company</b><br> As a natural consequence of the development of our company, we could be sold to another company. In the event that we are acquired by another company or a significant portion of our assets is sold to another company, all of the customer information including both financial records and consumer information that we have collected may be transferred to the new company.  <br><br> <b>Choice/Opt-out</b><Br> Users who no longer wish to receive our electronic newsletter or promotional materials from our partners may opt-out of receiving these communications by changing their settings in the "Your Account" section. Users who no longer wish to receive catalogs and other special announcements via postal mail can mail a letter to us at Customer Service, wine.com, Inc., 6135 NE 80th, Suite A-3, Portland, OR 97218; call 1-877-289-6886; or email us at <a href="mailto:customercare@wine.com">customercare@wine.com</a> and let us know that you would like to be removed from the mailing list.  <br><br> By using our Web site or purchasing a product from us, you agree to the collection and use of information as set forth in this privacy policy.

While continuing to steer the bimonthly magazine, Jim writes articles and offers advice for wine.com customers as our Editor at Large.  <br><br> It's not his first experience with Web journalism -- he was Vice President of Content for Drinks.com from 1999-2000. Readers of Wine Spectator magazine, however, know him as the long-time Managing Editor who directed the editorial staff and helped build that publication into the world's largest-circulation periodical on wine. He has been a professional wine taster since 1984, and has traveled throughout the U.S. and Europe to interview winemakers and report on their progress. <br><br> Jim started his journalism career in college, as editor of the Denison University newspaper in Ohio. He first got caught up in the wine world in 1979 when he took a job in Napa Valley as a reporter for a local weekly newspaper, the St. Helena Star. You could probably call him a wine fanatic, because he never tires of tasting (and drinking), learning about and writing on the subject. He has planted two backyard vineyards that never yielded much and makes wine at home (from other people's grapes). <br><br> <a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>	25	NULL

732	1	630	<span class=smalltext><b>How does the system work?</b><br> We use LinkShare's affiliate technology (<a class=smalllink href="http://www.linkshare.com" target="_new">http://www.linkshare.com</a>). LinkShare will track the visitors you send to our site and collect sales and traffic data. LinkShare takes no personal information or credit card data from the visitors. You will have access to an online reporting system that will provide you detailed statistics for your site, and allow you to understand what offer types are earning you the most commissions. <br><br> You earn commissions when a sale is shipped for a visitor you sent to us. LinkShare generates the commission statements, and when your site has earned more than $25 in commission, you will get a check from us after the month ends. <br><br> <b>Does it cost me anything to become an wine.com affiliate?</b><br> No, it's FREE! You can get started by accepting the eVineyard, Inc. <a class=smalllink href="http://merchant.linksynergy.com/fs/siteterm.html" target=_new">Legal Agreement</a> and filling out the <a class=smalllink href="https://ssl.linksynergy.com/php-bin/reg/sregister.shtml?mid=2025" target="_new">Online Application Form</a>. Once your site has been approved, visit LinkShare to add wine.com links to your site, and begin earning commissions immediately. <br><br> <b>How do I create links to wine.com?</b><br> Once your site is approved, log into your account at LinkShare and add appropriate links to your site from the wine.com links area. <br><br> <b>What is the commission structure? </b><br> We pay 6% commission on each purchase when referred sales are up to $1,000, and 8% commission when sales exceed $1,000 in a given month. (excluding any returns, applicable sales tax, coupons, and shipping and handling charges.) Example: A visitor to your page clicks on a wine.com banner, visits wine.com, and buys a case of wine for $100 (plus taxes, shipping and handling charges). Your 6% commission on this transaction is $6. Best of all, the more you sell, the greater the commission you can earn. If you sell more than $1,000 of wine.com products in a month, you will earn 8% commission.  <br><br> <b>How much can I earn?</b><br> We can't predict how much you will earn from the wine.com Program. However, we know from experience you'll earn more if you choose creative that works well with your site or let us know if you need something specific to your site. For example, if you are a site on the Loire Valley in France, we can create a text link that links specifically to the wine we sell from this region. <br><br> <b>Do I earn commissions on my own purchase?</b><br> Yes. When you buy products from wine.com, through your own link, you can earn the same commission on your own purchase. Think of it as a personal sale! <br><br> <b>Do affiliates get paid for repeat visits?</b><br> An affiliate gets commission fees on all sales generated through that affiliate site. Affiliates also get paid commissions if a visitor buys within 5 days of the initial referral - even if they don't return to wine.com through the same affiliate link. However, if a visitor to wine.com doesn't accept cookies, or if they visit wine.com through another affiliate link in the interim, the 5-day rule doesn't apply. <br><br> <b>What about product returns?</b><br> If a user returns a product for a refund, or if credit card charges are reversed due to a dispute or credit card fraud, your account will be debited for any commission earned on that transaction. (If a product is returned in exchange for new merchandise, or if goods are lost or damaged and we ship replacement goods to the customer, your commission will not be affected.) <br><br> <b>How often do I get paid?</b><br> Commission fees are paid monthly when the amount exceeds $25. If the commission fee is less than $25, the fees will rollover into the next month. Payments are processed approximately 30 to 45 days after the end of the month. <br><br> <b>Can I become an affiliate if my site is based outside the United States?</b><br> Yes, as long as you have visitors that reside in the US or are shipping to the United States. If you would like us to notify you when we add international shipping, please send an email to <a class=smalllink href="mailto:affiliate.manager@wine.com">affiliate.manager@wine.com</a>. <br><br> <b>Who do I contact if I have questions?</b><br> If you have any questions about the program or the application process please contact us at <a class=smalllink href="mailto:affiliate.manager@wine.com">affiliate.manager@wine.com</a>.

764	1	654	<b>Robert Mondavi:</b> <em>Interview with a winemaking legend</em> <br><br> The octogenarian founder of the Robert Mondavi Winery is as responsible as anyone for fashioning the high quality and polished style of today's California wines. He, his family and talented employees, over the years have initiated or popularized dozens of now widely accepted winemaking practices that brought California wines into the modern era in the 1960s and '70s. Ironically, Mondavi had to unlearn a number of other modern techniques in the next two decades to perfect the kind of handcrafted, European-style wines that were his long-time goal. <br><br> Robert Mondavi, for all his accomplishments and fame, is not an intimidating man in person. His smile and presence are charismatic and friendly. He appears fit, healthy and could easily pass for 15 years younger than his age. He loves to talk to the media. In fact he loves to talk, period. I interviewed him in his unassuming office suite in the Robert Mondavi Winery in Oakville, founded by Robert and his older son, Michael Mondavi, in 1966. <br><br> <b>Q. Do you remember when you started drinking wine?</b> <br> A. My mother, when I was 3 or 4 years old, gave us wine mixed with water. But never, as I grew up, did I see my father or my mother, my two sisters or my brother ever abuse it. <br><br> <b>Q. Do you have any advice for people about matching wine and food?</b> <br> A. Well, I've always said drink what you like; like what you drink. Very simple. This is what I've been advocating all the time.  <br><br> <b>Q. How did you improve your wines over the past 35 years?</b> <br> A. We've learned a lot. In the beginning we thought from a technical point of view that we could filter wines, we could add acid, we could do all of these things here to make the best wine possible, technically speaking. But as I traveled the world for the first time in 1962, and I began to taste the wines of Bordeaux and Burgundy, every time I tasted those they were gentle wines. They were wines with balance and harmony, with velvety character. And I began to say, 'Wait a minute, this is the kind of wine we should make.'  <br><br> <b>Q. So what did you change? </b> <br> A. That had to start in the vineyard.  We found that you could do that by planting your grapes in a new way to get more character. I also found that they were handling the Pinot Noir somewhat differently from the Cabernets, and Chardonnays completely different from the Rieslings. And I began to carry on experiments at our own winery, especially with small barrels. It added complexity, it added an oak character to it and it changed things completely. <br><br> <b>Q. Over the years you must have made this decision many times: Do you create the wine that the winemaker wants, or do you create the wine that the consumer wants? </b> <br> A. Well, we create the wine that we thought was the BEST wine. We used our judgment. And yet we found that what we wanted was what the consumer wanted.  <br><br> <b>Q. What was the most difficult wine to get right?</b> <br> A. Pinot Noir, by far. The most temperamental, because you need a cool climate, it's harder to grow the grapes, and it's much harder to make the wine. It's much more delicate, and you have to be a much better winemaker to make a good Pinot Noir. It's much easier to make a good Cabernet Sauvignon. <br><br> <b>Q. What was the idea behind Copia, the American Center for Wine Food and the Arts in Napa? </b> <br> A. I knew from the research work that we had done in what we called the Robert Mondavi Mission, that wine was part of our culture, part of our heritage, part of our religion, and that in moderation it was good for you. I realized that no one had put in one location a place where you could teach this to our children, our adults and our legislature, which needs a lot of education.  <br><br> <b>Q. What was the most memorable wine that you ever drank?</b> <br> A. Well, there was a hundred-year old Inglenook Cabernet Sauvignon and Pinot Noir from Napa Valley. I opened the Cabernet about an hour before dinner and decanted, and in the room the bouquet was amazing. At that time I was beginning to drink some of the French wines, the Bordeauxs, and I began to get that bouquet you get when the wine is 10 or 15 years old. Well, that wine of Inglenook outdid all of those.  <br><br> <b>Q. You seem to have been very good at looking into the future. Why is that?</b> <br> A. I've been lucky in that regard. It's very simple really--being open, being very honest, having an open mind. Common sense is what it is. There are many intelligent people, but very few with common sense.	24	NULL

12895	1	4023	<strong>Shipping Wine</strong>  <br><br>  As you may know, there are many laws and regulations regarding the shipment of wine across state lines, including the law that requires an adult signature to receive a package (many customers ship to their work address to ensure an adult is available to sign). We currently ship wine to <a href="/customercare/issue_view.asp?ID=11">26 states</a> accounting for 75% of the U.S. population through our network of 9 licensed retail outlets across the country. Because of our many shipping locations, our wine spends less time on trucks and we often surprise our customers with how quickly their orders arrive. For the remaining 25% of you, we can ship gourmet food and sweets gift baskets. We'll keep working to expand this as state laws allow!	26	About Us : Shipping

13175	1	4385	Most wine ranges from 10-16% alcohol by volume. Some varietals tend to have higher (for example Zinfandel and Cabernet Sauvignon) or lower alcohol levels (Pinot Noir and many white varietals), but there is always some variation from producer to producer. Some wine falls outside of this range, for instance Port weighs in closer to 20%, while Muscat and Riesling are usually a bit below 10%.	24	ABV - Alcohol By Volume Percentage Popup Text
